* Dataset involves customer data from an Ecommerce company that specializes in selling clothing online who also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions.
* This company allows online shopping to be done via a website or via a mobile app.
* In this project, I analyze the data using a linear regression model to check which one of the two methods is better for sales.

## [Project 2: Loan Default Prediction Model](https://github.com/praveen-sivashangaran/Predicting-loan-default)

* The LendingClub dataset for this project was obtained from Kaggle.
* LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company and the dataset contains historical data on loans given out in the past. 
* The objective of this project is to build a model that is capable of predicting if a potential borrower will pay back their loan. 
* Model involves a multi-layer neural network which utilizes the sigmoid function for binary classification (loan repaid: yes or no)
* Classification metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance
